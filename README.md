## Tidying the UCI HAR Data set

The script run_analysis.R processes the UCI-HAR dataset. The script can be run in the following way.
* change the working directory to the one that contains the script (using setwd("<folder_name>")).
* ensure that the UCI HAR data set is available in the working directory in unzipped format.
*Type source("run_analysis.R") into the R console and press enter .
* The script upon completion generates two tab limited files finalDataSet1.txt and finalDataSet2.txt. These contain the tidied up data. More description of what goes in these files can be found in the code book. (Please refer Summary Choices section in the codebook.md file in this repository).
